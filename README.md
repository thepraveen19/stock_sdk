Stock Trading System

This is a stock trading system that uses an API to fetch data for various stocks, performs analysis on the data, 
and uses the results to buy and sell stocks. The system stores all the data in a database for future reference.

Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:


credentials.py: This file will store the login credentials like usernames, passwords, and other secrets.

config.py: This file will store the API endpoint URLs.

api/: This folder will contain the API-related code.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat api directory as a package.
endpoints.py: This file will contain the code to connect with the API, fetch data and return it to the main program.
api_client.py: This file will contain the code to make api calls

analysis/: This folder will contain the code for analyzing the data.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat analysis directory as a package.
analysis.py: This file will contain the code to analyze the data fetched from the API and create a new table with the analyzed
data.

predictions/: This folder will contain the code for different prediction algorithms.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat predictions directory as a package.
algorithm1.py: This file will contain the code for the first prediction algorithm.
algorithm2.py: This file will contain the code for the second prediction algorithm.
algorithm3.py: This file will contain the code for the third prediction algorithm.
...: This folder can contain any number of prediction algorithm files.

trading/: This folder will contain the code for buying and selling stocks.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat trading directory as a package.
trading.py: This file will contain the code for buying and selling stocks using different strategies.

database/: This folder will contain the code for connecting to the database and storing the data.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat database directory as a package.
models.py: This file will contain the SQLAlchemy model classes for the database tables.
database.py: This file will contain the code for connecting to the database, creating the tables, and inserting data into them.

utils/: This folder will contain utility functions that can be used across the project.
__init__.py: This file is needed to treat utils directory as a package.
helpers.py: This file will contain the helper functions that can be used across the project.
main.py: This file will be the entry point of the program and will tie together all the different parts of the program.
logger.py: This logs everything in log.txt file. However, a seperate logger based on dates is created by fyers api by default.
README.md: This file will contain information about the project.
requirements.txt: This file will contain a list of all the required Python packages and their versions.



Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Update credentials.py with your API credentials.
Usage
To run the system, simply execute the main.py script:
python main.py
The system will connect to the API, fetch data for various stocks, perform analysis on the data, and use the 
results to buy and sell stocks. All the data will be stored in the database for future reference.
